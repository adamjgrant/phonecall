      <h1>For $10/month, I will call your phone daily to hold you accountable</h1>
      <div class="available yes"></div>
      <h2>But why?</h2>
      <p>When we were kids, adults were always setting boundaries and keeping us on task. We thought this was annoying and relished the day when we'd grow up and get to do whatever we want. And here we are with that freedom only to find it's not that simple.</p>
      <p>We try to stay off our phones but we keep picking it up in the bedroom costing us our sleep and making us late. We need to break through task paralysis but we end up waiting until the last minute instead.</p>
      <p>Now we realize how privileged we were to have someone on the outside keeping us in check.</p>
      <p>We try to solve the problem by beating ourselves up, setting up reminders, calendar events, notifications, and apps but our brains know we can just swipe away and ignore to give in to our urge to mindlessly scroll and waste time.</p>
      <p><strong>Research shows having an actual living human being keeping us accountable makes all the difference.</strong></p>
      <p>It's easy to let ourselves down, but harder to do that to someone else.</p>
      <blockquote>"This service has completely transformed my productivity. Knowing someone is going to call and check in makes all the difference!" - Jane D.</blockquote>
      <h2>How does it work?</h2>
      <p>You and I discuss what you want to be held accountable for. <strong>For about 33Â¢ per day</strong>, I will personally call you on your phone once daily on as many days as you want at the time of your choosing. Each call is a minute, give or take, just enough time for me to ask if you did what you were supposed to do or are going to. If need be, I'll instruct you to text me back as a follow up. Whatever it takes to keep you accountable.</p>
      <h2>Why a human phone call?</h2>
      <p>Don't get me wrong, I'm a nice guy but unlike a notification, you're not paying me to put up with your lame excuses. If you can't follow through on the reminder, we'll have a discussion about that and you will have questions to answer.</p>
      <blockquote>"I was skeptical at first, but the daily calls have kept me on track in ways I never imagined. Highly recommend!" - John S.</blockquote>
      <h2>Examples</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>"At 8:30PM I want you to call me and tell me it's time to power down my phone completely."</li>
        <li>"Remind me to take my medication every day at 9:00 AM and 9:00 PM."</li>
        <li>"Call me at 6:00 AM to make sure I start my morning workout routine."</li>
        <li>"Check in with me every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday to confirm I've completed my assigned readings for my online course."</li>
        <li>"Call me at 10:00 PM to ensure I've prepared my lunch for the next day."</li>
        <li>"Make sure I submit my weekly expense report every Friday by 3:00 PM."</li>
        <li>"Remind me every evening at 7:00 PM to spend 30 minutes on my side project."</li>
        <li>"Ensure I practice my musical instrument daily at 4:00 PM."</li>
        <li>"Remind me to review my financial goals and budget every Sunday at 5:00 PM."</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>FAQ</h2>
      <h3>You're not taking on new clients! Is there a waitlist?</h3>
      <p>Yes, email me.</p>

      <h3>Is this a real human calling me?</h3>
      <p>Yes, it's literally me picking up my own phone and calling you.</p>

      <h3>Is it always you calling?</h3>
      <p>For the time being, yes. I think it makes a difference that you're consistently being held accountable by the same person. In this way, we form a kind of relationship of accountability. I don't currently hire anyone else for this.</p>

      <h3>Who are you?</h3>
      <p>I'm a 38 year old program manager based in the Silicon Valley. I also run a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@AdamGrantDotInfo">YouTube channel on ADHD at work</a> if you want to get to know me.</p>

      <h3>What are you like on the phone?</h3>
      <p>I want you to feel icky disappointing me by not following through but the conversation will always maintain a respectful tone.</p>
      <p>That you would go so far as to pay for this service tells me this is something important to you, and that motivates me to keep you at your best.</p>
      <p>That being said, you're paying me to do a job and that doesn't include validating your lame excuses or otherwise making you feel better about missing your goals.</p>

      <h3>What if I need a break?</h3>
      <p>The deal is that I hold you accountable, not entertain excuses. That being said, <strong>life happens</strong> and it's best that you let me know ahead of time and use the tool I'll provide for managing your subscription.</p>
      <p>If you need a temporary pause in services, reach out ahead of time as much as possible so you don't lose your spot if other customers are waiting.</p>

      <h3>Is there a free trial?</h3>
      <p>Shoot me an email about what you're looking for and we'll make something work for you.</p>

      <h3>Does it have to be a phone call?</h3>
      <p>In addition to phone calls, I can also send text messages or emails if that works better for you. Let's discuss what fits your lifestyle best.</p>
      
      <h2>Privacy and Confidentiality</h2>
      <p>Your privacy is my priority. All personal information and the details of your goals will be kept strictly confidential. I respect your trust and will ensure that our interactions remain private.</p>
